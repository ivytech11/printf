This README file provides an overview of the requirements and specifications for a printf function that produces output according to a given format. The project consists of several tasks with varying levels of difficulty, and each task builds upon the previous one.

The first task involves writing a basic printf function that can handle the conversion specifiers 'c', 's', and '%'. The function must be able to output to stdout and return the number of characters printed.

The second task requires adding support for the conversion specifiers 'd' and 'i'.

The third task introduces a custom conversion specifier, 'b', which converts an unsigned integer to binary.

The fourth task requires using a local buffer of 1024 characters to minimize the number of times the write function is called.

The fifth task introduces another custom conversion specifier, 'S', which prints strings and replaces non-printable characters with their hexadecimal ASCII codes.

The sixth task adds support for the 'p' conversion specifier.

The seventh task involves handling the flag characters '+', 'space', and '#'.

The eighth task requires adding support for length modifiers 'l' and 'h' for conversion specifiers 'd', 'i', 'u', 'o', 'x', and 'X'.

The ninth task involves handling field width for non-custom conversion specifiers.

The tenth task requires handling precision for non-custom conversion specifiers.

The eleventh task adds support for the '0' flag character.

The twelfth task involves handling the '-' flag character.

The thirteenth task introduces another custom conversion specifier, 'r', which prints a reversed string.

The fourteenth task adds support for the 'R' custom conversion specifier, which applies the rot13 cipher to a string.

The fifteenth task requires implementing all the above options to work well together.

The project is hosted on GitHub and contains a repository named "printf".
